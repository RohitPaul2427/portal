"""Sweep B.4 — Mega Dispatch country workflow seeder (India + expansions).

Sub-Slice B.4.2 — India NEW (12 visas).
Sub-Slices B.4.3..9 to be added incrementally per Sir's Atomic Ship dispatch.

Idempotent — skips if a workflow with same (country_code, subclass_id, service_type)
already exists with status='verified'. Reuses `seed_country` and `backfill_country`
from b2 to avoid duplication.

Usage:
    cd /app/backend && python -m scripts.seed_country_workflows_b4 --country IN
    cd /app/backend && python -m scripts.seed_country_workflows_b4 --backfill IN

Sources cited per workflow in `verified_notes`. Fees verified against MHA + Indian

#
# Research-driven corrections vs Sir's brief (NZ/UK/USA/DE precedent):
#   - Sir said "uniform €80 fee since 2024 raise from €60" → ACTUAL raise was
#     €60 → €90 (NOT €80) effective Jun 11, 2024. Confirmed by European
#     Commission + AXA Schengen + Atlys + Economic Times + Mfa.ee + Tripcabinet.
#   - Sir said "ETIAS scheduled mid-2025" → POSTPONED to Q4 2026 (Oct-Dec window).
#   - Sir said "EES Oct 2024 delayed; verify Feb 2026 status" → CONFIRMED:
#     phased start Oct 12, 2025; full mandatory April 10, 2026 (mid-rollout now).
